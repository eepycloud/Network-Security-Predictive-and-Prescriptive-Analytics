## Project Objectives
- **Predictive Analytics:** Develop models to forecast key network metrics such as Time-to-Live (TTL), Hop Count, and Rate of Energy Consumption.
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Determine optimal strategies for minimizing risk scores across network nodes.
- **Implementation:** Use Python to implement predictive and prescriptive models.
- **Presentation:** Deliver a comprehensive presentation detailing the methodology, findings, and actionable recommendations.

## Key Components
- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Feature selection techniques: Select From Model, SelectKBest, Forward/Backward Sequential Feature Selector, Recursive Feature Elimination.
  - Regression models: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNNR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Random Forest Regressor.
  - Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, MSE, R-squared.
  
- **Prescriptive Analytics:**
  - Optimization of risk score using a weighted formula considering TTL, Hop Count, and Rate of Energy Consumption.
  - Constraint-based optimization to minimize risk while ensuring network security.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebooks:**
  - `predictive_analytics.ipynb`: Contains the code and analysis for predictive modeling.
  - `prescriptive_analytics.ipynb`: Contains the code and analysis for prescriptive modeling.
  
- **Presentation:**
  - `presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the methodology, results, and recommendations.
